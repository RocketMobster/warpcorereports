## LCARS Sound Effects

The application includes authentic LCARS sound effects for a more immersive experience. To set up the sound files:

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Navigate to the sound generator tool in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5173/sound-generator.html
```

3. Use the interactive interface to preview the sounds and generate all sound files at once.

4. Download the generated MP3 files to your computer.

5. Move all the downloaded sound files to the `/public/sounds/` directory in your project.

6. Refresh your application - you should now hear authentic LCARS sounds when interacting with the UI!

You can customize the sound experience using the sound control panel in the application header.

## Randomize Controls

For quick exploration and fine-tuned randomness:

- "ðŸŽ²" buttons appear beside many controls and will randomize just that field:
	- Problems, Problem Detail Level, Graphs On/Off, Graph Count, Starship, Signing Engineer, Rank, Seed, and Humor Level
- "Randomize All" randomizes all controls at once (respects the seed lock if enabled)
- Tooltips on each "ðŸŽ²" button explain exactly what will be randomized

Tip: Lock the seed to keep results reproducible even when randomizing other controls.

## Stardate Calculator

- Toggle the panel below the main controls with "Show Stardate Calculator".
- Convert Calendar Date â†” Stardate using common TOS/TNG-era approximations.
- Enable "Use Stardate in Report" to apply the calculatorâ€™s stardate to generated reports.
- When enabled, the current override value is shown inline next to the toggle.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Other modern browsers with ES6 support

## Privacy

All processing is done locally in your browser. No server backend is used for report generation, and no data is sent to external servers.

## Recent Fixes

- **Report Share Feature**: Fixed the error when generating DOCX files during report sharing. The application now properly generates DOCX files with charts, and falls back to a simplified version if chart rendering fails.
- **Report Regeneration**: Fixed an issue where regenerating reports or changing seeds didn't update the report content.

## Roadmap
