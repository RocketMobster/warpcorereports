[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-rocketmobster.github.io%2Fwarpcorereports-blue?logo=github)](https://rocketmobster.github.io/warpcorereports/)

Help modal: scrollable body and dedicated "References & Canon Names" section with anchors.

New info button next to "Allow Canon Names in References" opens Help directly to the References section.

Anchors wired for Figure Bias, Templates, Presets, and Produce vs Reroll; added "references" target.

README synced with in-app Help (labels, one-per-entry, defaults, share keys: cn, ce, ff, fm).

Note: No generator behavior changes; UX/docs improvements only.
